        This website provides a basic primer for what the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) is intended to be and how 
        it works.  The site does make some lofty claims, such as its claim that it is "The Internet that should have 
        been, will be soon."  Nonetheless, it is a good starting point to understand I2P.
