    summary: |-
        The article "Experimental Observation of the Quantum Hall Effect" by Tsui, St√∂rmer, and Gossard presents
        groundbreaking research on the quantum Hall effect (QHE), a phenomenon observed in two-dimensional electron
        systems subjected to low temperatures and strong magnetic fields. The authors detail their experimental setup,
        which involves a high-purity gallium arsenide (GaAs) heterostructure, and describe the conditions under which
        the QHE was observed. They report the quantization of the Hall resistance, which occurs at discrete values
        that are integer multiples of a fundamental constant, highlighting the robustness of this effect against
        variations in temperature and sample quality. The work emphasizes the significance of the QHE in understanding
        quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics, as it provides insights into electron interactions and the
        behavior of electrons in low-dimensional systems. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings
        for future research, including potential applications in metrology and quantum computing. This seminal paper
        has had a profound impact on the field, leading to further investigations into fractional quantum Hall states
        and the development of new theoretical frameworks. The experimental techniques and results presented have
        become foundational in the study of quantum phenomena in solid-state systems.
