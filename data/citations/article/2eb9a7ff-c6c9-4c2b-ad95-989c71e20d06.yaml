    summary: "Maldacena and Susskind argue that quantum entanglement (EPR) and non-traversable wormholes (Einstein–Rosen \nbridges) are two descriptions of the same underlying relation—“ER=EPR.” Starting from the thermofield-double \npicture of two maximally entangled black holes, they show that the classical geometry contains an ER bridge \nlinking the horizons, yet remains non-traversable, so no superluminal signaling occurs. They then recast the\nAMPS firewall paradox in this setting: operations that distill or manipulate Hawking-partner quanta outside \none hole correspond to dramatic, but still causally consistent, changes behind the other hole’s horizon. In \nthis view, apparent paradoxes stem from trying to ascribe simultaneous, incompatible descriptions to entangled\nsubsystems. The paper illustrates how interior experience for an infaller can remain smooth while exterior \nobservers perform complicated, computationally hard manipulations on the entangled partner, and it frames \nblack-hole interiors as state-dependent constructs tied to patterns of entanglement. Broadly, ER=EPR suggests\nspacetime connectivity is a manifestation of entanglement structure, linking quantum information to geometry\nand offering a route to resolve firewall-type tensions without violating causality.\n"
