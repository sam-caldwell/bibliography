    summary: |-
        The work titled "A Survey of the State of the Art in Natural Language Generation: Core Tasks, Applications and
        Evaluation" provides a comprehensive overview of the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG). The authors
        systematically categorize the core tasks involved in NLG, such as content determination, text structuring, lexical
        choice, and surface realization. They discuss various applications of NLG, including automated report generation,
        dialogue systems, and summarization, highlighting the versatility and significance of NLG in enhancing human-computer
        interaction. The survey also addresses the evaluation of NLG systems, examining both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation
        methods. The authors emphasize the challenges in assessing the quality of generated text, noting the subjective nature
        of language and the importance of context in evaluation metrics. Furthermore, the paper identifies key trends and future
        directions in NLG research, suggesting areas for improvement and innovation. Overall, this work serves as a foundational
        reference for researchers and practitioners in the field, offering insights into the current state of NLG, its
        applications, and the methodologies used for evaluation. It underscores the ongoing evolution of NLG technologies and
        their potential impact on various domains.
