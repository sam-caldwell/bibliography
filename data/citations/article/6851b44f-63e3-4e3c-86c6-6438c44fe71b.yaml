    summary: |
        This paper proposes several practical ways in which an adversary can exploit weaknesses in the "dark web" 
        Invisible Internet Project (I2P) to achieve various unintended goals against its users.  The paper presents 
        many justifications for not implementing decentralized systems using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT), which 
        ultimately becomes a virtually centralized target.
