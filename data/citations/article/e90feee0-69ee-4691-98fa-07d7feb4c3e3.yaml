    summary: "Microservice systems are often deployed in complex cloud-based environments and may involve a large number of \nservice instances being dynamically created and destroyed. It is thus essential to ensure observability to \nunderstand these microservice systemsâ€™ behaviors and troubleshoot their problems. As an important means to \nachieve the observability, distributed tracing and analysis is known to be challenging. While many companies \nhave started implementing distributed tracing and analysis for microservice systems, it is not clear whether \nexisting approaches fulfill the required observability. In this article, we present our industrial survey on \nmicroservice tracing and analysis through interviewing developers and operation engineers of microservice \nsystems from ten companies. Our survey results offer a number of findings. For example, large microservice \nsystems commonly adopt a tracing and analysis pipeline, and the implementations of the pipeline in different \ncompanies reflect different tradeoffs among a variety of concerns. Visualization and statistic-based metrics \nare the most common means for trace analysis, while more advanced analysis techniques such as machine learning \nand data mining are seldom used. Microservice tracing and analysis is a new big data problem for software \nengineering, and its practices breed new challenges and opportunities.\n"
