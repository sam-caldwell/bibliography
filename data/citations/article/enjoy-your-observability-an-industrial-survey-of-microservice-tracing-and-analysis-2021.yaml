    summary: |
      Microservice systems are often deployed in complex cloud-based environments and may involve a large number of 
      service instances being dynamically created and destroyed. It is thus essential to ensure observability to 
      understand these microservice systemsâ€™ behaviors and troubleshoot their problems. As an important means to 
      achieve the observability, distributed tracing and analysis is known to be challenging. While many companies 
      have started implementing distributed tracing and analysis for microservice systems, it is not clear whether 
      existing approaches fulfill the required observability. In this article, we present our industrial survey on 
      microservice tracing and analysis through interviewing developers and operation engineers of microservice 
      systems from ten companies. Our survey results offer a number of findings. For example, large microservice 
      systems commonly adopt a tracing and analysis pipeline, and the implementations of the pipeline in different 
      companies reflect different tradeoffs among a variety of concerns. Visualization and statistic-based metrics 
      are the most common means for trace analysis, while more advanced analysis techniques such as machine learning 
      and data mining are seldom used. Microservice tracing and analysis is a new big data problem for software 
      engineering, and its practices breed new challenges and opportunities.
