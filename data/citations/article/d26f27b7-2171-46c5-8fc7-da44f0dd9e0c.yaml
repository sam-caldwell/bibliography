    summary: |
        This presentation at the 2021 Korean virtual event on privacy addressed gaps in the security of query 
        information stored on systems running the Invisible Internet Project (I2P) where the query information written 
        to the Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is not encrypted and may create legal or ethical issues for unsuspecting 
        volunteer operators.  The presentation goes on to propose a "Private Information Retrieval" (PIR) solution 
        for DHTs
