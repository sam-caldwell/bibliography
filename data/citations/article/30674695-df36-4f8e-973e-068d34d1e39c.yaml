    summary: |
        This article provides some historical context for the ever-present battle between privacy interests and the 
        government's interest in accessing information under the cover of "public safety."  In this article the 
        Clinton-era movement to install an NSA-designed  "clipper chip" on every telecommunications device and its 
        demise are discussed.  This is especially relevant where it discusses the discovery of a security flaw by 
        AT&T Bell Laboratories researchers late in the controversy, demonstrating the dangers of so-called "back doors"
        to encryption
