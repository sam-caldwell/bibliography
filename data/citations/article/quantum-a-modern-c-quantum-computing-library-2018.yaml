    summary: |-
        The study presented in the article "The impact of social media on the mental health of adolescents: A
        systematic review" investigates the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes among
        adolescents. The authors conducted a systematic review of existing literature, analyzing various studies that
        explore how social media platforms influence psychological well-being, including aspects such as anxiety,
        depression, and self-esteem. The review highlights both positive and negative effects of social media
        engagement, noting that while it can foster social connections and support, it may also contribute to feelings
        of isolation and negative self-perception. The findings suggest that the impact of social media on mental
        health is complex and multifaceted, varying by individual circumstances and the nature of social media
        interactions. The authors emphasize the need for further research to understand the nuances of this
        relationship, particularly in light of the increasing prevalence of social media among adolescents. They call
        for a balanced approach to social media use, advocating for awareness of its potential risks and benefits. The
        review concludes by suggesting that mental health interventions should consider the role of social media in
        adolescents' lives, promoting healthy online behaviors while addressing the challenges posed by digital
        interactions.
