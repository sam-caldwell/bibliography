    summary: |
        Benford’s Law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers—such as financial data or 
        scientific measurements—the leading digit is more likely to be small (1, 2, or 3) than large. Formally, the 
        probability that the first digit is \(d\) is given by \(\log_{10}(1 + \frac{1}{d})\). This pattern often 
        emerges in data sets that span several orders of magnitude, and it’s frequently used to detect anomalies or 
        potential fraud in accounting and other numeric data.
