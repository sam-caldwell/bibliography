    summary: |
        This article describes some of the security issues with centralized or semi-decentralized systems like Tor 
        in an increasingly surveillance oriented world where both criminal and nation-state threat actors have 
        increased capabilities and privacy-focused solutions like Tor are shown to have non-trivial flaws.
