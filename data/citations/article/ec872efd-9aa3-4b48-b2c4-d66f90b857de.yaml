    summary: "Lov K. Grover’s 1996 STOC paper introduces a quantum search algorithm that locates a single “marked” item in \nan unstructured database of size N using O(√N) oracle queries, versus Θ(N) classically. The algorithm prepares\na uniform superposition over N indices and iterates two unitary steps: a phase flip of the marked state(s) via\nan oracle and an inversion about the mean (the diffusion operator). Each Grover iteration coherently amplifies\nthe marked amplitude, producing a rotation in a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the marked state and the\naverage of unmarked states. After approximately (π/4)√N iterations, measuring the register returns the solution\nwith high probability. The paper proves the query complexity is within a constant factor of optimal for this\nproblem and sketches extensions to multiple matches, where about O(√(N/M)) iterations suffice when M items are\nmarked. Conceptually, the speedup arises from constructive and destructive interference shaped by simple \nreflections, not massive parallelism alone. Although idealized—assuming a black-box oracle and noiseless\nunitaries—the result established a canonical limit for unstructured search and seeded a broad family of \namplitude-amplification techniques used across quantum algorithms. Grover’s construction remains a cornerstone\nexample demonstrating provable quadratic advantage under minimal structure assumptions, complementing Shor’s\nexponential-speedup results for factoring.\n"
