        This whitepaper describes a Distributed VPN (dVPN) solution based on a public block chain.  The technology 
        emerged during the blockchain craze of 2020-2022 and establishes some of the arguments against traditional 
        centralized virtual private network (VPN) products.  Unfortunately it also illustrates the ethical issue of 
        promising greater security while using a public block chain to facilitate allegedly secure access for users.
        In light of Greenberg's "Tracers in the Dark" these claims raise concerns.
