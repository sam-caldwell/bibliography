    summary: "In this essay, we argue that the emergence of classically connected space–times is intimately related to the \nquantum entanglement of degrees of freedom in a nonperturbative description of quantum gravity. Disentangling \nthe degrees of freedom associated with two regions of space–time results in these regions pulling apart and \npinching off from each other in a way that can be quantified by standard measures of entanglement.\n"
