    summary: |
        This article provides a rarely discussed view of Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA), which is often 
        drowned out by marketing companies from ZTNA vendors like Zscaler, Palo Alto Networks or Microsoft.  In this 
        discussion, many concerns and counterpoints to the mainstream thought are made and possible solutions are 
        suggested.
