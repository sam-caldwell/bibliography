    summary: |
        Following the San Bernadino shooting and years of failed attempts to legislate "back doors" into encrypted 
        systems, this article shows the atmosphere of Congress in 2019 to force "back doors" in encryption systems, 
        regardless of the mathematical consequences to security. (This should be read in consideration of the 2016 
        amended Russian law and what was required by Russian technologists to accommodate their country's similar 
        expectations.)
