    summary: |
        Maldacena and Susskind argue that quantum entanglement (EPR) and non-traversable wormholes (Einstein–Rosen 
        bridges) are two descriptions of the same underlying relation—“ER=EPR.” Starting from the thermofield-double 
        picture of two maximally entangled black holes, they show that the classical geometry contains an ER bridge 
        linking the horizons, yet remains non-traversable, so no superluminal signaling occurs. They then recast the
        AMPS firewall paradox in this setting: operations that distill or manipulate Hawking-partner quanta outside 
        one hole correspond to dramatic, but still causally consistent, changes behind the other hole’s horizon. In 
        this view, apparent paradoxes stem from trying to ascribe simultaneous, incompatible descriptions to entangled
        subsystems. The paper illustrates how interior experience for an infaller can remain smooth while exterior 
        observers perform complicated, computationally hard manipulations on the entangled partner, and it frames 
        black-hole interiors as state-dependent constructs tied to patterns of entanglement. Broadly, ER=EPR suggests
        spacetime connectivity is a manifestation of entanglement structure, linking quantum information to geometry
        and offering a route to resolve firewall-type tensions without violating causality.
