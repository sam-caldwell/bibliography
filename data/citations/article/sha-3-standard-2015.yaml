    summary: |-
        The document "NIST FIPS 202: SHA-3 Standard: Permutation-Based Hash and Extendable-Output Functions" outlines
        the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the SHA-3 cryptographic hash function. Developed by the
        National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), SHA-3 is designed to provide a robust and secure method
        for generating hash values, which are essential for data integrity and authentication in various applications.
        The standard specifies the underlying algorithm, which is based on a permutation-based construction known as
        the Keccak algorithm. This approach allows for a high degree of flexibility, supporting variable-length
        outputs and enabling the creation of extendable-output functions. The document details the technical
        specifications, including the design rationale, security considerations, and implementation guidelines for
        SHA-3. It also discusses the performance characteristics of the algorithm and its suitability for various
        cryptographic applications. By establishing SHA-3 as a standard, NIST aims to enhance the security of
        cryptographic systems and provide a reliable alternative to earlier hash functions, such as SHA-1 and SHA-2,
        which have shown vulnerabilities over time. This standard is crucial for organizations seeking to adopt secure
        cryptographic practices in their information technology frameworks.
