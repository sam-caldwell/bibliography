    summary: |-
        The article titled "A Comprehensive Review on the Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Smart Cities"
        provides an extensive overview of the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies within the
        framework of smart city development. The authors systematically categorize various AI applications across
        multiple domains, including transportation, energy management, healthcare, and public safety. They highlight
        how AI enhances urban living by improving efficiency, sustainability, and quality of life for residents. The
        review discusses specific AI techniques, such as machine learning, natural language processing, and computer
        vision, and their practical implementations in smart city initiatives. Furthermore, the authors address the
        challenges and limitations associated with deploying AI in urban environments, including data privacy
        concerns, algorithmic bias, and the need for robust infrastructure. They emphasize the importance of
        interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders, including government, industry, and academia, to overcome
        these hurdles. The article concludes with recommendations for future research directions, advocating for the
        development of ethical frameworks and policies to guide the responsible use of AI in smart cities. Overall,
        this comprehensive review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in the
        intersection of AI technology and urban development.
