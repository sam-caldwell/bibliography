    summary: |
        This paper focuses on a Zero Trust-based framework that utilizes blockchain and PUF technology for securing 
        the supply chain of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs).  This is useful in demonstrating the value of 
        block chain when information (such as supply chain attestation) can be published publicly as opposed to other 
        use-cases where a public block chain ledger is less appropriate.
