    summary: |
        A landmark Supreme Court case that addressed whether a public figure could recover damages for emotional 
        distress caused by a satirical magazine parody. The Court held that the First Amendment protects even 
        offensive, outrageous satire about public figures, provided there is no false statement knowingly or 
        recklessly made. This decision underscored the importance of robust free speech protections in public 
        discourse, even when that speech is crude or insulting.
