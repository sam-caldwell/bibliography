    summary: |
        With the outstanding growth in the number of consumer Internet of Things (IoT) connected devices, especially
        boosted by smart home applications and wearables, there is a need to provide such devices with security. If 
        any device in such consumer IoT systems gets compromised, a data leak may cause serious threats to privacy, 
        material losses, and even put people's lives at risk. Therefore, in this article, we focus on challenges 
        associated with the trust involving communication between IoT devices, which is a key security-related 
        characteristic in consumer IoT applications. A mathematical trust metric, based on a two-level approach, 
        is used to illustrate how the presented proposal can be useful in the objective assessment of confidence and,
        consequently, provide better security among IoT devices.
