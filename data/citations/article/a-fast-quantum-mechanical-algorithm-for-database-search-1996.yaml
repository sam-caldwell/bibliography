    summary: |
        Lov K. Grover’s 1996 STOC paper introduces a quantum search algorithm that locates a single “marked” item in 
        an unstructured database of size N using O(√N) oracle queries, versus Θ(N) classically. The algorithm prepares
        a uniform superposition over N indices and iterates two unitary steps: a phase flip of the marked state(s) via
        an oracle and an inversion about the mean (the diffusion operator). Each Grover iteration coherently amplifies
        the marked amplitude, producing a rotation in a two-dimensional subspace spanned by the marked state and the
        average of unmarked states. After approximately (π/4)√N iterations, measuring the register returns the solution
        with high probability. The paper proves the query complexity is within a constant factor of optimal for this
        problem and sketches extensions to multiple matches, where about O(√(N/M)) iterations suffice when M items are
        marked. Conceptually, the speedup arises from constructive and destructive interference shaped by simple 
        reflections, not massive parallelism alone. Although idealized—assuming a black-box oracle and noiseless
        unitaries—the result established a canonical limit for unstructured search and seeded a broad family of 
        amplitude-amplification techniques used across quantum algorithms. Grover’s construction remains a cornerstone
        example demonstrating provable quadratic advantage under minimal structure assumptions, complementing Shor’s
        exponential-speedup results for factoring.
