    summary: |
        The classic example of shared hidden data transformation is the Invisible Internet Protocol (I2P), which 
        works with Tor web-net and make incognito relay confidential. The I2P offers an outstanding possibility 
        for people seeking anonymity to circumvent authoritarian regimes. It can also be troublesome in corporate 
        environments where I2P-routers over-use restricted web-net assets or provide a means for malware to exfiltrate
        information. In this research paper, the authors discussed the IDS possibility to track I2P web-net congestion 
        and associate peers positively is done. Additionally, the authors given context details on the internal
        mechanisms of I2P, and showed the ways to recognize I2P routers throughout the bootstrapping process. The 
        development and review of the new system is of the current state of the art. We intend to introduce Blockchain
        techniques for tracking Darkweb User Activities on a trust computational web-net to improve data protection in
        transparent blockchains (BC).
