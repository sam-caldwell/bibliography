    summary: |
        A well-known principle for designing robust public key protocols is
        as follows: "Do not assume that a message you receive has a
        particular form (such as g^r for known r) unless you can check this"
        [AN95].  This is the sixth of the eight principles defined by Ross
        Anderson and Roger Needham at Crypto '95.  Hence, it is also known as
        the "sixth principle".  In the past thirty years, many public key
        protocols failed to prevent attacks, which can be explained by the
        violation of this principle [Hao10].
        
        While there may be several ways to satisfy the sixth principle, this
        document describes one technique that allows one to prove the
        knowledge of a discrete logarithm (e.g., r for g^r) without revealing
        its value.  This technique is called the Schnorr NIZK proof, which is
        a non-interactive variant of the three-pass Schnorr identification
        scheme [Stinson06].  The original Schnorr identification scheme is
        made non-interactive through a Fiat-Shamir transformation [FS86],
        assuming that there exists a secure cryptographic hash function
        (i.e., the so-called random oracle model).
        
        The Schnorr NIZK proof can be implemented over a finite field or an
        elliptic curve (EC).  The technical specification is basically the
        same, except that the underlying cyclic group is different.  For
        completeness, this document describes the Schnorr NIZK proof in both
        the finite field and the EC settings.
