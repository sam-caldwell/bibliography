        The paper "End-to-End Arguments in System Design" by Jerome Saltzer, David P. Reed, and David D. Clark
        presents a foundational principle in network and system design known as the end-to-end argument. This
        principle asserts that certain functions in a distributed system should be implemented at the endpoints of a
        communication system rather than at intermediary nodes. The authors argue that placing functionality at the
        endpoints enhances reliability and efficiency, as it allows for more straightforward error handling and
        application-specific processing. The paper discusses various examples, such as error detection and recovery,
        to illustrate how end-to-end design can lead to more robust systems. It critiques the tendency to implement
        features at lower levels of the network stack, which can complicate system design and reduce overall
        performance. The authors emphasize that while there are exceptions where intermediate nodes may perform
        certain functions, the general guideline favors end-to-end implementation for critical services. This work has
        significantly influenced the design of network protocols and distributed systems, promoting a clearer
        understanding of where to allocate resources and responsibilities within system architecture. The end-to-end
        argument remains a key consideration in contemporary discussions about system design and network architecture.
