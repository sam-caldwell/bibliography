    summary: |
        This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey
        event notification messages.  This protocol utilizes a layered
        architecture, which allows the use of any number of transport
        protocols for transmission of syslog messages.  It also provides a
        message format that allows vendor-specific extensions to be provided
        in a structured way.
        
        This document has been written with the original design goals for
        traditional syslog in mind.  The need for a new layered specification
        has arisen because standardization efforts for reliable and secure
        syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and
        transport-independent RFC.  Without this document, each other
        standard needs to define its own syslog packet format and transport
        mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility
        issues.  This document tries to provide a foundation that syslog
        extensions can build on.  This layered architecture approach also
        provides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each
        syslog feature rather than once for each transport.
        
        This document obsoletes RFC 3164.
