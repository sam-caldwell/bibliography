        The article from Cloudflare provides an overview of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, a conceptual
        framework used to understand and implement network communication protocols in seven distinct layers. The OSI
        model serves as a guide for designing and troubleshooting network systems, facilitating interoperability among
        diverse communication systems. The seven layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session,
        Presentation, and Application. Each layer has specific functions and protocols, with the Physical layer
        dealing with the transmission of raw data, while the Application layer interfaces directly with end-user
        applications. The article explains the significance of the OSI model in standardizing network communication,
        which allows different systems to communicate effectively. It also highlights how the model aids in diagnosing
        network issues by isolating problems to specific layers. The OSI model is contrasted with the simpler TCP/IP
        model, which is more commonly used in practical applications. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance
        of the OSI model in the field of networking, providing a foundational understanding for both professionals and
        students in the domain of information technology and telecommunications.
