    summary: "The eCTD 3.2.2 specification defines a standardized, XML-based format for regulatory submissions built on \nfive CTD modules, with Module 1 reserved for region-specific requirements and Modules 2–5 harmonized globally;\nsubmissions are delivered as numbered “sequences” that manage life-cycle operations (new, replace, delete) \nthrough a backbone index.xml, prescribed folder hierarchy, metadata, and file constraints (e.g., PDF use, \nbookmarking, hyperlinks), while validation rules and additional details are provided in regional Module 1 \nspecs and agency conformance guides; although v4.0 exists, 3.2.2 remains the globally implemented baseline.\n"
