    summary: |-
        The document provides an overview of the Quantum Virtual Machine (QVM) developed by Rigetti Computing, which
        serves as a simulator for quantum circuits. It emphasizes the QVM's role in enabling users to run quantum
        programs on classical hardware, facilitating the development and testing of quantum algorithms without the
        need for actual quantum processors. The QVM is designed to mimic the behavior of quantum systems, allowing for
        the exploration of quantum computing concepts and the execution of quantum circuits written in the Quil
        programming language. The document outlines the installation process, usage instructions, and key features of
        the QVM, including its ability to handle various quantum operations and measurements. It also discusses the
        integration of the QVM with the Forest platform, which provides additional tools and resources for quantum
        programming. Furthermore, the document highlights performance considerations and limitations of the QVM,
        noting that while it can simulate quantum circuits effectively, it may not capture all aspects of quantum
        behavior due to the constraints of classical computation. Overall, the QVM serves as a valuable resource for
        researchers and developers looking to engage with quantum computing in a simulated environment.
