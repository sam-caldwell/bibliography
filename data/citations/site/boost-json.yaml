    summary: |-
        The Boost.JSON library documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the Boost.JSON library, which is
        part of the larger Boost C++ Libraries. This library facilitates the manipulation of JSON data in C++
        applications, offering a range of features for parsing, serializing, and manipulating JSON objects and arrays.
        The documentation outlines the library's core components, including the data types used to represent JSON
        values, such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, and booleans. Key functionalities include the ability to
        parse JSON strings into usable data structures and to serialize these structures back into JSON format. The
        library supports both standard and custom error handling, ensuring robust parsing and manipulation of JSON
        data. Additionally, the documentation includes examples and usage patterns that illustrate how to effectively
        implement the library in various programming scenarios. The Boost.JSON library is designed with performance
        and ease of use in mind, making it suitable for both novice and experienced C++ developers. The documentation
        also provides guidance on installation, configuration, and integration with existing Boost libraries,
        emphasizing the library's compatibility and versatility within the C++ ecosystem. Overall, the Boost.JSON
        library serves as a valuable resource for developers working with JSON in C++.
