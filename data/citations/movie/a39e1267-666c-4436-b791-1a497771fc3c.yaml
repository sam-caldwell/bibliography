    summary: |
        Office Space is a satirical comedy film that explores the mundane and often absurd realities of corporate 
        life. The story follows Peter Gibbons, a disenchanted software engineer who is fed up with his oppressive 
        work environment and the monotonous routines of his job at Initech. After undergoing a hypnotherapy session 
        that leaves him in a state of blissful apathy, Peter decides to take a stand against his boss and the 
        corporate culture that stifles creativity and individuality. Alongside his quirky coworkers, he embarks on a 
        series of humorous escapades that challenge the status quo. The film cleverly critiques the dehumanizing 
        aspects of office work, making it a cult classic that resonates with anyone who has experienced the 
        frustrations of corporate life.
