    summary: |-
        "XML in Record Time" by Michael D. Smith is a practical guide designed to introduce readers to the
        fundamentals of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) and its applications in various domains. The book emphasizes
        a hands-on approach, enabling readers to quickly grasp XML concepts and implement them effectively. Smith
        covers essential topics such as XML syntax, structure, and the significance of well-formed documents. He also
        explores advanced features like namespaces, schemas, and transformation techniques using XSLT (eXtensible
        Stylesheet Language Transformations). The text is structured to cater to both beginners and those with some
        prior knowledge of markup languages, making it accessible for a wide audience. Each chapter includes examples
        and exercises that reinforce learning and encourage practical application. Additionally, the author discusses
        the role of XML in web development and data interchange, highlighting its relevance in modern computing
        environments. Overall, "XML in Record Time" serves as a comprehensive resource for individuals seeking to
        enhance their understanding of XML and its capabilities, providing a solid foundation for further exploration
        of related technologies and standards in the field of data representation and web services.
