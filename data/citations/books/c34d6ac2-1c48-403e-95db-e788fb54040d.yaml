    summary: |-
        "Computer Graphics" is a comprehensive text that explores the fundamental concepts and techniques in the field
        of computer graphics. The work delves into the mathematical and algorithmic foundations that underpin graphic
        rendering, including topics such as geometric transformations, rasterization, and shading models. It addresses
        both 2D and 3D graphics, providing insights into the processes involved in creating visual representations on
        digital platforms. The book also discusses various applications of computer graphics, ranging from video games
        and simulations to scientific visualization and user interface design. It emphasizes the importance of
        understanding the hardware and software components that contribute to graphics rendering, including graphics
        processing units (GPUs) and rendering engines. In addition to theoretical concepts, the text includes
        practical examples and exercises that encourage readers to apply their knowledge. The author aims to equip
        students and professionals with the skills necessary to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of computer
        graphics technology. Overall, this work serves as a foundational resource for anyone interested in the
        principles and practices of creating and manipulating visual content through computational means.
