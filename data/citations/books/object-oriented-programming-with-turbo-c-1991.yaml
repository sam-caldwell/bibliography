    summary: |-
        "Object-Oriented Programming with Turbo C" is a comprehensive guide that introduces readers to the principles
        and practices of object-oriented programming (OOP) using the Turbo C programming environment. The book covers
        fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, providing a solid
        foundation for understanding OOP methodologies. It emphasizes practical applications and includes numerous
        examples and exercises to reinforce learning. The text begins with an overview of the Turbo C environment,
        guiding users through the setup and basic functionalities before delving into more complex OOP concepts. Each
        chapter builds on the previous one, ensuring a gradual progression in difficulty. The author employs clear
        explanations and illustrative code snippets to demonstrate how OOP can be effectively utilized in software
        development. Additionally, the book addresses common pitfalls and best practices in OOP, making it a valuable
        resource for both beginners and those looking to enhance their programming skills. By the end of the book,
        readers are expected to have a thorough understanding of how to implement object-oriented programming
        techniques in Turbo C, preparing them for more advanced programming challenges. This work serves as both a
        textbook for students and a reference for practitioners in the field.
