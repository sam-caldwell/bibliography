    summary: "Like any set of oral reflections, \"The Character of Physical Law\" has special value as a demonstration of the \nmind in action. The reader is particularly lucky in Richard Feynman. One of the most eminent and imaginative \nmodern physicists, he was Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology until his\ndeath in 1988. He is best known for his work on the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, as well as for\nhis later research in the field of low-temperature physics. In 1954 he received the Albert Einstein Award for\nhis \"outstanding contribution to knowledge in mathematical and physical sciences\"; in 1965 he was appointed to\nForeign Membership in the Royal Society and was awarded the Nobel Prize.\n"
