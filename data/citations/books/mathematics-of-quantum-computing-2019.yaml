    summary: |
        This textbook presents the elementary aspects of quantum computing in a mathematical form. It is intended as 
        core or supplementary reading for physicists, mathematicians, and computer scientists taking a first course on
        quantum computing. It starts by introducing the basic mathematics required for quantum mechanics, and then 
        goes on to present, in detail, the notions of quantum mechanics, entanglement, quantum gates, and quantum 
        algorithms, of which Shor's factorisation and Grover's search algorithm are discussed extensively. In addition,
        the algorithms for the Abelian Hidden Subgroup and Discrete Logarithm problems are presented and the latter is
        used to show how the Bitcoin digital signature may be compromised. It also addresses the problem of error 
        correction as well as giving a detailed exposition of adiabatic quantum computing. The book contains around 
        140 exercises for the student, covering all of the topics treated, together with an appendix of solutions.
