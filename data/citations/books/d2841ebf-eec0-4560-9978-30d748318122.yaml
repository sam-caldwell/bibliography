    summary: |-
        The black-market corruption of the Brezhnev era proved the perfect breeding ground for organized crime. 
        Beginning in the 1970s, Soviet emigres - including a large number of felons and murderers the USSR was happy 
        to get rid of - began arriving in the United States and a number of them quickly established themselves as a 
        major criminal force in New York, Las Vegas, and elsewhere.

        But it was the breakup of the Soviet Union that made the Russian mob what it is today. In a weakened, 
        impoverished Russia, it quickly became the dominant power. And it has now spread to every corner of the United
        States, infiltrating its banks and brokerage firms - and American law enforcement is just waking up to this 
        enormous problem.
