    summary: |
        Col. Lunev served in the Soviet and Russian Federation military intelligence (GRU), defecting to the United 
        States in the early 1990s. In Through the Eyes of the Enemy, former Soviet military intelligence officer 
        Stanislav Lunev presents an inside look at Russian espionage operations targeting the United States. As the 
        highest-ranking GRU defector to date, he details clandestine strategies to weaken America from within, 
        shedding light on covert funding, infiltration of vital industries, and preparedness for potential sabotage. 
        His firsthand accounts illustrate the broader scope of Cold War espionage and highlight the lingering threats 
        still posed by Russian intelligence networks after the Soviet collapse.
