    summary: |
        The song "All the Things" by the hip-hop duo Dual Core, composed of American rapper int eighty (David 
        Martinjak) and British producer c64 (Chris Hunger), is a celebration of hacker culture and the subculture 
        surrounding digital security and technology. The track, released in 2012 as part of their album All The Things,
        features lyrics that depict a relentless, strategic approach to hacking, including drinking alcohol, hacking 
        systems, and backdooring firmware. The chorus, with its repeated lines "Drink all the booze, hack all the 
        things," serves as a rallying cry for hackers to immerse themselves in their craft and push technological 
        boundaries.
