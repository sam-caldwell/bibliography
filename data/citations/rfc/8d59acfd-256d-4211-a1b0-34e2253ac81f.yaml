    summary: "This document describes the syslog protocol, which is used to convey event notification messages. This \nprotocol utilizes a layered architecture, which allows the use of any number of transport protocols for \ntransmission of syslog messages. It also provides a message format that allows vendor-specific extensions \nto be provided in a structured way. This document has been written with the original design goals for \ntraditional syslog in mind. The need for a new layered specification has arisen because standardization \nefforts for reliable and secure syslog extensions suffer from the lack of a Standards-Track and \ntransport-independent RFC. Without this document, each other standard needs to define its own syslog packet \nformat and transport mechanism, which over time will introduce subtle compatibility issues. This document \ntries to provide a foundation that syslog extensions can build on. This layered architecture approach also \nprovides a solid basis that allows code to be written once for each syslog feature rather than once for each \ntransport.\n"
