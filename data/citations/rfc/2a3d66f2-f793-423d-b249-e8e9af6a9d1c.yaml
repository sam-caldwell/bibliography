    summary: |
        Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) is a protocol that serves as a tool for other protocols in dealing 
        with Network Address Translator (NAT) traversal. It can be used by an endpoint to determine the IP address and 
        port allocated to it by a NAT. It can also be used to check connectivity between two endpoints, and as a 
        keep-alive protocol to maintain NAT bindings. STUN works with many existing NATs, and does not require any 
        special behavior from them. STUN is not a NAT traversal solution by itself. Rather, it is a tool to be used in 
        the context of a NAT traversal solution. This is an important change from the previous version of this 
        specification (RFC 3489), which presented STUN as a complete solution. This document obsoletes RFC 3489."
