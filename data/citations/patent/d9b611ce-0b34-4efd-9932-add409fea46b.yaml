    summary: |
        Techniques for computer-implemented automation of analysis of service maturity and automation of estimation of 
        service maturity for software applications and services are provided, identifying a service to determine the 
        service maturity level compared to an identified task comprising optimal service maturity criteria. In response
        to identifying the service and task, determining that each criteria of the task is met by the service. 
        Subsequently, updating a score for the overall task and the individual criteria based on the total service 
        conformity to the criteria. The scores and differences can be displayed in an interface to indicate the 
        maturity of the service.
