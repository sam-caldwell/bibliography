    summary: |
        “Accepted the Risk” is a parody infosec music video that skewers how some organizations treat “risk 
        acceptance” as a magic stamp to ship faster and dodge real remediation. A swaggering “risk manager” 
        breezes past auditors, waves around governance buzzwords and certs, and rubber-stamps decisions even 
        when products handling sensitive data are clearly insecure.
